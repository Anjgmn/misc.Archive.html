    <img src="debarge.jpg" width=300px>
    <p>I've been thinkin' 'bout you for quite a while<br>
      You're on my mind everyday and every night<br>
My every thought is you, the things you do<br>
Seems so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl<br>
Ooh, and I like it<br>
You send chills up my spine every time<br>
I take one look at you<br><br></p>
<p>Ooh, and I like it<br>
Girl, you're blowin' my mind with the things you say to me<br>
I like the way you comb your hair<br>
And I like those stylish clothes you wear<br>
It's just the little things you do<br>
That show how much you really care<br>
Like when I'm all alone with you<br>
You know exactly what to do<br>
You put that fire inside of me<br>
And make it more than just a dream</p>
